                     LIVE SKILL EXCHANGE PLATFORM

SkillSphere is an innovative live interface platform designed to connect individuals 
based on their skills, allowing them to showcase portfolios, enhance learning 
through structured programs, and engage in mentorship. The platform 
emphasizes Collaborative Learning Sprints and Mentor-Mentee Pairing, enabling 
users to gain real-world experience, engage in guided mentorship, and 
continuously develop their skills. Additionally, a badge-based recognition system 
ensures that users are rewarded for their efforts and achievements. 
 
Note: AI integration will be considered if feasible, ensuring it enhances user 
experience and adds value to the platform. If AI proves impractical within the 
scope of the project, alternative data-driven and algorithmic approaches will be 
explored to optimize skill matching and mentorship.
